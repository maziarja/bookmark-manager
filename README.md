## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add new bookmarks with a title, description, website URL, and tags
- View all their bookmarks
- See bookmark details including favicon, title, URL, description, tags, view count, last visited date, and date added
- Search for bookmarks by title in the search bar
- Filter bookmarks by selecting one or multiple tags from the sidebar
- Reset tag filters to view all bookmarks again

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - For styles
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) - For accessible and composable UI components
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) - For data modeling and database management
- [NextAuth.js (v5)](https://authjs.dev) - For authentication

### What I learned

This is the first time I'm using **shadcn/ui**. I tried to customize it to match the design challenge as closely as possible.  
I also used this very practical website to help me: (https://tweakcn.com)

### Useful resources
